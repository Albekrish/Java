Encoding:
 	-It is the process of converting text/data file into some other universally accepted formats like UTF, ASCII, etc. 
 	-API -> URL->UTF8 encoding

Encryption:
	-It is the technique to completely modify data into some other format with the help of key (which is known only by the 
	client who will be decrypting the data). This is mainly used for data security.
	-This is so important during file transfer to avoid data theft.

Hashing:
	-Hashing is a technique/algorithm to convert the data into another format that can be used for grouping.
	-We always have to choose proper hashing technique to avoid collision.

	-In java, we use hashing to find the position/index of data to be stored in hash table.	Here key/element is used to 
	find index using hashing function and stored in hash table like key-value pair. This helps in faster retrieval of data.
