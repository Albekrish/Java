Different between abstract and Interface:

Abstract:
-Contains abstract and concrete methods.
-It have constructor and almost act as normal class but we can't create object.
-Multiple inheritance problem will occur.
-Mostly preferred for noun type of data (eg. while booking tickets, we can 
give discount to passenger based on age, membership, etc. here we can keep 
discount method as abstract in Passenger.class)

Interface:
-contains abstract, default and static methods
-It don't have constructor and it is a special type of class.
-By default, variables are public static final (i.e constant)
-By default, methods are public abstract  & for other methods, must to 
define default/ static along with method name.
-Supports multiple inheritance problem.
-Mostly we prefer for action type of methods (eg. button submit)
